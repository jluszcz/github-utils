# github-utils

Reusable GitHub Actions workflows shared across `jluszcz` repositories. Fix once
here; every consumer picks it up on its next run.

Consumers pin the moving major tag `@v1`. Patch/minor fixes move `v1`; breaking
changes are cut as `v2` (Dependabot opens `@v1`→`@v2` PRs).

## Callers

Each caller declares a `permissions:` block. A called reusable workflow's job
permissions cannot exceed the caller's `GITHUB_TOKEN` permissions, and these
repos default to `contents: read` only — so the caller must grant the ceiling
the reusable job needs, or the job fails to start.
