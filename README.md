# github-utils

Reusable GitHub Actions workflows shared across `jluszcz` repositories. Fix once
here; every consumer picks it up on its next run.

Consumers pin the moving major tag `@v1`. Patch/minor fixes move `v1`; breaking
changes are cut as `v2` (Dependabot opens `@v1`→`@v2` PRs).

## This repo's own protection

`main` is protected by a repository ruleset (mirroring the other `jluszcz`
repos): no branch deletion, no force-push, linear history required, and all
changes land via PR (0 required approvals, squash/rebase merges only).

Required status checks:

- **`Lint Workflows`** — `actionlint` over `.github/workflows/**` (see
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml`).
- **`claude-review / claude-review`** — this repo dogfoods its own reusable
  review workflow via `.github/workflows/self-claude-code-review.yml`. This
  check is only required once the `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` secret is set on the
  repo; without it the review job cannot run.

`.github/workflows/self-claude.yml` likewise dogfoods the interactive `@claude`
workflow (not a required check).

Inspect or edit the ruleset with the procedure in
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-20-shared-workflows.md` (fetch via
`gh api repos/jluszcz/github-utils/rulesets/<id>`; PUT back `name,target,
enforcement,conditions,rules,bypass_actors`).

## Callers

Each caller declares a `permissions:` block. A called reusable workflow's job
permissions cannot exceed the caller's `GITHUB_TOKEN` permissions, and these
repos default to `contents: read` only — so the caller must grant the ceiling
the reusable job needs, or the job fails to start.
